    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon! Madame does not know that this is a smoking-carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes. Monsieur is very good. It is that my husband would smoke. He is
      an old soldier. He smokes all the time. <i>Ciel!</i> They are like
      chimneys, these old soldiers. This man of mine regrets that he cannot
      smoke when he is asleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Madame delivered this address she continued also to mount the steps,
      and as she finished it she seated herself in the corner of the carriage
      opposite to me. She was short and round and sixty years old, and smiling
      like the sun on a fine day. Her dress was the charming dress of Aries, but
      over her kerchief she wore a silk mantle that glittered with an embroidery
      of jet beads. This mantle was precious to her. Her first act upon seating
      herself was to take it off, fold it carefully in a large handkerchief, and
      lay it safely in the netting above her head. She replaced it with a red
      knitted shawl, partly as a shield against the dust, and partly as a
      protection against the fresh wind that was blowing briskly down the valley
      of the Rhône.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment her husband followed her, bowing to me as he entered the
      carriage. Seating himself beside her, and giving her plump hand a little
      affectionate pat, he said: &ldquo;It is all right, little one. Marie will
      receive her jelly in good condition. I myself saw that the basket was
      placed right side up in the carriage. The jelly will not spill.&rdquo; Then,
      turning to me, he added: &ldquo;My wife makes a wonderful jelly of apricots,
      Monsieur. We are taking some of it to our married daughter, who lives in
      Avignon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a well set-up old boy, with a face most pleasantly frank, close-cut
      gray hair, short gray whiskers, and a bristling white mustache. Across his
      forehead, cutting through his right eyebrow, was a desperate scar, that I
      at once associated in my own mind with the red ribbon of the Legion that
      he wore in the button-hole of his black frock-coat. He looked the officer
      in retreat, and the very gentleness and sweetness of his manner made me
      sure that he had done some gallant fighting in his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train pulled out from the station&mdash;it was at Tarascon that
      they had joined me&mdash;he drew forth from his pocket a black little
      wooden pipe and a tobacco-bag. This was my opportunity. I also drew forth
      a pipe and a tobacco-bag. Would Monsieur accept some of my tobacco? I
      asked. I had brought it, I added, from America; it was tobacco of the
      Havana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur then is an American. That is interesting. And his tobacco is
      from the Havana, that is more interesting still. My cousin&rsquo;s son has been
      for many years in America. His name is Marius Guiraud; he lives in San
      Francisco; possibly Monsieur and he have met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur regretted that he had not had this pleasure, and explained that
      his home was in New York&mdash;three times as far from San Francisco as
      Marseilles was from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name of a name! Is it possible? How vast this America must be! And they
      tell me&mdash;&rdquo; Here he struck a wax match and paused to light his pipe.
      He drew a dozen whiffs in silence, while on his face was the thoughtful
      look of one whose taste in tobacco was critical and whose love for it was
      strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder of guns, but it is good!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he took the pipe from
      his mouth and passed it lightly back and forth beneath his nose. &ldquo;Had we
      smoked tobacco like this in the Crimea we should have whipped those rascal
      Russians in a single week. Ah, that we often were without tobacco was the
      hardest part of all. I have smoked coffee grounds and bay, Monsieur, and
      have been thankful to get them&mdash;I myself, who well know what is good
      and what is not good in a pipe! This tobacco&mdash;it is divine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur served in the Crimea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the proof of it,&rdquo; he said, a little grimly, touching the scar on
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; his wife added, touching the bit of red ribbon in his
      button-hole. &ldquo;He was the bravest man in all that war, Monsieur, this old
      husband of mine. His cross was given him by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tchut, little one! What does Monsieur care how I got my cross? It was not
      much that I did. Any man would have done the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the others did <i>not</i> do the same. They ran away and left thee to
      do it alone. Did not his Majesty tell thee&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur hears what a <i>babillarde</i> it is. If she were given her
      own way she would swear that I commanded the allied armies, and that I
      blew up the Redan and stormed the Malakoff and captured Sebastopol all
      alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Monsieur what thou didst do,&rdquo; said the little woman, warmly. &ldquo;Tell
      him truly precisely what thou didst do, and then let him judge for himself
      if what I have said be one bit less than thy due.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so bring Monsieur to know that I am a babbling old woman like
      thyself?&rdquo; He pinched her gently, and then settled himself back against the
      cushion as though with the intention of giving himself wholly to the
      enjoyment of his pipe: yet was there a look in his eyes that showed how
      strong was the desire within him&mdash;the desire that is natural to every
      brave and simple-minded old soldier&mdash;to tell the story of his
      honorable scars. Even had I felt no desire to hear this story, not to have
      pressed him to tell it would have been cruel. But little pressing was
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since Monsieur is good enough to desire to hear what little there is to
      tell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and to show him how foolish is this old woman of mine, I
      will tell him the whole affair. It is a stupid nothing; but Monsieur may
      be amused by the trick that was put upon me by those great generals&mdash;yes,
      that certainly was droll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our regiment, Monsieur, was the Twenty-seventh of the Line. It was drawn
      almost wholly from the towns and villages in these parts: Aries and
      Tarascon and Saint-Remy and Salon and Maillane and Château Renard&mdash;there
      is the old château, over on the hill yonder, beside the Durance&mdash;and
      Barbentane, that we shall see presently around the corner of the hill. We
      all were <i>Provençaux</i> together, and the men of the other regiments of
      our division gave us the name of the Provence cats; though why they gave
      us that foolish name I am sure they never knew any more than we did
      ourselves. It was not because we were cowards, that I will swear: our
      regiment did some very pretty fighting in its time, as any one may know by
      reading the gazettes which were published in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our division held Mont Sapoune&mdash;the French right, you know&mdash;facing
      the Little Redan across the Carenage Ravine. It was early in the siege,
      and we had only drawn our first parallel: close against the Selinghinsk
      and Vallyrie redoubts, and partly covering the ground where we dug our
      rifle-pits later on. But we were going ahead with our work fast, and
      already we had thrown up the little redoubts known as No. 11 and No. 15,
      which covered the advancing earthwork leading to where our second parallel
      was to begin. Redoubt No. 11 was a good hundred yards, and Redoubt No. 15
      was more than three times that distance outside of our lines; and
      everybody knew that these two advanced posts would be in great danger
      until our second parallel was well under way. So very possible was it that
      they might be surprised, and the guns turned on our own lines in support
      of a general attack, that in each of them spikes and hammers were kept in
      readiness against the need for spiking the guns before they fell into the
      enemy&rsquo;s hands. Our regiment lay just behind these redoubts, in the rear of
      the artillerymen who manned our trenches; and as the gunners had plenty to
      do all day long, and through the night too sometimes, the work of keeping
      up the night pickets fell to our share.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was while things were this way that I was on picket early one morning
      on our extreme left, close over the edge of the Carenage Ravine. I had
      come on with the midnight relief, and by five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when
      day wras just breaking, my teeth were chattering and I was stiff with
      cold. Name of a name, but it was cold those winter mornings! We have
      nothing like it, even when the worst mistral is blowing, in our winters
      here in Provence. Down in the ravine there was a thick mist, into which I
      could not see at all; but every now and then a whiff of wind would come in
      from the seaward and thin it a little, and then I would give a good look
      below me, for it was along the ravine that any party sent out to surprise
      us almost certainly would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was while the light still was faint that I thought I heard, coming up
      through the mist, a little rattling sound, such as might be made by a man
      stumbling and dropping his musket among the broken rocks. Just then the
      mist was too thick for me to see twenty feet below me. I was sure that
      something bad was going on down there, but I did not want to make a fool
      of myself by giving a false alarm. All that I could do was to cock my
      musket and to hold it pointed towards where the sound seemed to come from,
      all ready, should there be need for it, to give the alarm and get in a
      shot at the enemy at the same time. Truly, Monsieur, it seemed to me that
      I stood that way, while my heart went pounding against my ribs, for a
      whole year! I was no longer cold: the blood was racing through my veins,
      and I was everywhere in a glow. Suddenly there came a puff of wind, and as
      the mist thinned for a moment I saw that the whole ravine was full of
      Russians. Their advance already was half-way up the bank nearest to our
      works. In less than ten minutes the whole of them would be dashing into
      our outlying redoubts. As I pulled the trigger of my musket I tried to
      shout, but my throat was as dry as a furnace and I could only gasp. And&mdash;will
      you believe it?&mdash;my musket missed fire! Name of a name, what a state
      I was in! There was the enemy coming on under cover of the mist; and there
      was I, the only man who could save our army, standing dumb like a useless
      fool!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I must do came to me like a flash. If I ran back inside of our lines
      to give the alarm, the chances were a thousand to one that the enemy would
      have the outlying redoubt, very likely would have them both, and would
      turn the guns before help could come. But I knew, at least I hoped, that
      there was time for me to get to the more exposed redoubt ahead of them and
      give the word to spike the guns. It was all in an instant, I say, that I
      found this thought in my mind, and my musket and cartridge-box thrown I
      don&rsquo;t know where, and myself dashing off through the mist across the
      broken ground like a deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I rushed into the redoubt our men thought that I was the Russians; and
      when they knew me by my uniform for a Frenchman, and heard me crying in a
      hoarse whisper, &lsquo;Spike the guns!&rsquo; they thought that I was mad. But the
      lieutenant in command of the battery had at least a little sense, even if
      he did not have much courage, and he looked towards where I pointed&mdash;and
      then he saw the shakos, as the mist lifted again, not a hundred feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Save yourselves, I will make the guns safe,&rsquo; he cried to his men&mdash;he
      was not all a coward, poor fellow&mdash;and as they ran for it he picked
      up the spikes and the hammer. Tap! tap! tap! one gun was spiked. Tap! tap!
      tap! another. Then we heard the Russians beginning to scramble up outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He swore a great oath as he dropped the hammer. &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be done. Run,
      cat!&rsquo; he cried&mdash;and away he started after his men. The name that I
      called him as he ran away, Monsieur, was a very foul name; God forgive me
      for what I said! But I was determined that it <i>should</i> be done. In a
      second I had picked up the nails and the hammer, and&mdash;tap! tap! tap!&mdash;the
      third gun was safe. &lsquo;Run, cat!&rsquo; I heard the lieutenant call again. But&mdash;tap!&mdash;I
      had the nail started in the last gun, and then, right above me, was a
      Russian major and with him a dozen of his men. Tap! and I had the nail
      half-way home as the major jumped down beside me, with his sword raised. I
      knew that I could parry his blow with the hammer and then, possibly, get
      away; but I wanted to make sure that that gun could not be turned. And so&mdash;it
      was quick thinking that I did just then, Monsieur&mdash;tap! and the gun
      was no better than old iron! At that same instant it seemed to me that the
      whole world burst into a tremendous roar and ten thousand blazing stars&mdash;but
      it only was the sword of that confounded Russian major banging against my
      skull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little woman was almost sobbing. She took her husband&rsquo;s hand in both
      of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see that I was <i>not</i> killed, little one,&rdquo; he said; and he
      raised her hands to his lips and kissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not until the next day, Monsieur,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I knew
      anything. Then I was in the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How did it go?&rsquo; I asked of the hospital-steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Shut up,&rsquo; said the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This made me angry. &lsquo;How did it go, <i>polisson?</i>&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Tell me,
      or I&rsquo;ll crush your bones.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the man was more civil. &lsquo;The Russians were driven back,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;and a lot of them were captured. You owe it to the same Russian major who
      almost killed you that your life was saved. As soon as he was brought into
      camp he sent a message to the general begging that you might be looked
      after quickly. If there was any life left in you, it was worth saving, he
      said, for you were a brave man&mdash;and he told how you had spiked those
      last two guns! <i>Parbleu</i>, but for that message you would have died!
      When they brought you in here you were nearly gone!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And the lieutenant who ran away?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, he was killed&mdash;as he deserved. Now you know all about it. Hold
      your tongue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt so foolishly weak, and there was such a pain in my head as I began
      to remember it all once more, that I could not ask any more questions.
      Presently my head began to buzz and the pain in it to get worse, and then
      for a week I had a fever that came near to taking me off. But I pulled
      through&rdquo;&mdash;he squeezed his wife&rsquo;s hand, that again had been laid in
      his&mdash;&ldquo;and in three weeks I was back with the regiment again. It was
      all due to my having such a wonderfully thick skull, the doctors said,
      that the major&rsquo;s sword had not broken it past all mending. When I came
      into camp the boys all cheered me, and I was as proud as a cock. And then,
      the first thing I knew, up came a corporal and a file of men and arrested
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What am I arrested for?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For being absent without leave from your regiment during battle,&rsquo; said
      the corporal, and marched me off to the guard-house. Then I was not proud
      at all. But I was very angry. That I should be arrested in this fashion
      did not seem to me fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour back came the corporal and his file of men. This time
      they took me to headquarters. In we went; and the corporal stood beside
      me, and his men behind me in a row. It seemed as though half the officers
      of our army were there: my colonel, the general of our brigade, the
      general of our division, half a dozen other generals, three or four
      English officers in their smart red coats; presently there was a stir&mdash;and
      in came the Emperor! What the deuce it all meant I could not tell at all!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Private Labonne,&rsquo; said my colonel, he spoke in a very harsh tone, yet it
      seemed to me that there was an odd sort of twinkle in his eye&mdash;&lsquo;you
      deserted your post, and you were absent without leave when your regiment
      went into action.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not a word of excuse, Private Labonne. You know the penalty.&rsquo; I did know
      the penalty, of course; it was to be taken out and shot. I began to think
      that this was worse than the Russians!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When shall I order the court-martial, your Majesty?&rsquo; asked my colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will be the court-martial,&rsquo; said the Emperor. &lsquo;This is a serious
      matter; this is a matter to be dealt with in a hurry. The case is proved.
      There is no need for a trial. I order Private Labonne to be shot right
      away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shivered all down my back. It <i>was</i> worse than the Russians; very
      much worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Take him away,&rsquo; said my colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The corporal put his hand on my shoulder and the guard closed in.
      &lsquo;March!&rsquo; said the corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said the Emperor. &lsquo;Private Labonne, before you are taken away and
      shot, tell me what you were doing in that battery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing, your Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing? I thought that I heard something about guns being spiked. Did
      not you spike a gun, Private Labonne?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did not you spike two guns&mdash;and both of them after the gunners and
      the officer in command of the battery had run away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And why did you not run away, too, Private Labonne?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Because I wanted to spike the guns, your Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You did not think, then, that it was your duty as one of my soldiers to
      save your life by running with the others?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This question puzzled me, for I certainly never had thought of the matter
      in that way at all. It occurred to me that perhaps I really had not done
      my duty. But what the Emperor said, for all that he was the Emperor, did
      not seem reasonable, and I made bold to answer him: &lsquo;If I had taken care
      of my own life, your Majesty, a great many of your soldiers would have
      died to pay for it. It would have been a bad day&rsquo;s work if those two guns
      had not been spiked, for the Russians certainly would have turned them on
      our lines.&rsquo;

      &ldquo;The Emperor turned to my colonel. &lsquo;There is something in what Private
      Labonne says, eh, colonel? I suppose there really would have been the very
      devil to pay had the enemy turned those guns?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose there would,&rsquo; said my colonel, a little grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then the case is not quite so black against Private Labonne as it at
      first appeared?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not quite so black,&rsquo; said my colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps we need not have him shot, after all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps not&mdash;not this time, at least.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We might even compliment him a little upon his bravery. For it was
      rather brave&mdash;eh, colonel?&mdash;to stay in that battery and spike
      those guns, while a hundred Russians were tumbling in upon him, and his
      own comrades had run off and left him to do his duty and to die for it
      there alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My colonel&rsquo;s voice broke a little as he answered, &lsquo;It was very brave,
      your Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Eh, well, Private Labonne,&rsquo; said the Emperor, turning again to me, &lsquo;we
      won&rsquo;t shoot you. Your colonel is right about your bravery; and to shoot a
      brave man, except in battle, is a mistake. The Russian officer who came so
      near to killing you was a major, I am told; well, you may happen to meet
      him again, and if you do it is only fair that your rank should equal his.
      Here is your commission, Major Labonne; and here is a little thing &lsquo;&mdash;it
      was his own cross of the Legion that the Emperor gave me&mdash;&lsquo;that I
      want you to wear in remembrance of that day when you did as brave a piece
      of work as ever was done by a French soldier for the honor of France!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you see, Monsieur, it was only a comedy about my being shot, after
      all. Here is Avignon. You must wait for me a moment, little one, while I
      get the basket of jelly for Marie.&rdquo;
